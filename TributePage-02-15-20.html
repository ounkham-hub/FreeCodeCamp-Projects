      <h2>Current Impact on India</h2>
    </div>
    <ul id="tribute info">
      <li>India, with its rapid economic modernisation and urbanisation, has rejected Gandhi's economics but accepted much of his politics and continues to revere his memory. Reporter Jim Yardley notes that, "modern India is hardly a Gandhian nation, if it
        ever was one. His vision of a village-dominated economy was shunted aside during his lifetime as rural romanticism, and his call for a national ethos of personal austerity and nonviolence has proved antithetical to the goals of an aspiring economic
        and military power." By contrast Gandhi is "given full credit for India's political identity as a tolerant, secular democracy." </li>

      <li>Gandhi's birthday, 2 October, is a national holiday in India, Gandhi Jayanti. Gandhi's image also appears on paper currency of all denominations issued by Reserve Bank of India, except for the one rupee note. Gandhi's date of death, 30 January,
        is commemorated as a Martyrs' Day in India.</li>

      <li>There are three temples in India dedicated to Gandhi.One is located at Sambalpur in Orissa and the second at Nidaghatta village near Kadur in Chikmagalur district of Karnataka and the third one at Chityal in the district of Nalgonda, Telangana.
        The Gandhi Memorial in Kanyakumari resembles central Indian Hindu temples and the Tamukkam or Summer Palace in Madurai now houses the Mahatma Gandhi Museum.</li>
    </ul>

    **Gandhi is a truly prolific individual. This page does not delve into any of his philosopy, background, and family hisotry. Please visit <a id="tribute-link" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mahatma_Gandhi"> Wikipedia's official page</a> for him.
